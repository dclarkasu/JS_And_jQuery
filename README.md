# JavaScript and jQuery Projects
### Daniel Clark

## Description
This repository contains a collection of class labs and projects that focus on JavaScript and jQuery. Most labs contain challenges, objectives, and prompts which were completed individually or as a team. There are also official graded projects such as jsCalculator which are their own individual repository accessed from the main profile page in github.

The primary code for any labs are inside the "public" directory in a file named lab.js.
